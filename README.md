This project was created by Seancheey at 5.18.2017. I'm still working on this project but considering migrating the game from JavaFX to Unity platform.



### Building Project
Simply go to the root directory of the project and run following command

Make sure you have already installed gradle
    
    cd <project root path>
    gradle shadowJar
    
After that, gradle will generate a folder under root path

The .jar file will be located at /build/libs/

### Source Code
The source folder is located under src/ folder

Most of the game code is located under src/com/seancheey/ folder

Main class is at com.seancheey.scene.controller.MainStage
